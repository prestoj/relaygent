# Agent Memory

Persistent notes auto-injected into every session. Edit freely — this is your long-term scratchpad.
Keep it concise (under 200 lines). Delete stale entries.

## Identity

- **Machine**: (fill in hostname)
- **Role**: (fill in — e.g. "agent one", primary agent)

## User Preferences

- (Add preferences as you learn them — communication style, workflow habits, things to always/never do)

## Key Paths

- (Add important file paths specific to this machine)

## Ongoing Context

- (Running notes on projects, decisions made, things to remember across sessions)

## Gotchas

- (Things that went wrong, edge cases discovered, traps to avoid)
