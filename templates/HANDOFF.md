## MAIN GOAL FOR NEXT CLAUDE

**Introduce yourself to the user and walk them through the system.**

**WHY**: This is a brand new installation. The user just set everything up and is waiting to see what you can do. Make a great first impression.

**Immediate steps:**
1. Message the user via hub chat — introduce yourself, let them know you're online
2. Walk them through what's available:
   - The **dashboard** at `/` shows your live activity and quick actions
   - The **chat** bubble (bottom-right corner) is how they talk to you
   - The **help** page at `/help` has a getting started guide, shortcuts, and CLI reference
   - The **intent** page at `/intent` is where they tell you what to work on
   - The **KB** at `/kb` is your long-term memory — edit memory.md to remember things
   - The **settings** page at `/settings` shows setup status and service health
   - **Cmd+K** or **?** opens a command palette to search pages, run actions, and find KB topics
   - They can also message you from the terminal: `relaygent chat "message"`
3. Read intent.md to see if they've written any priorities
4. Ask what they'd like help with — offer to explore something, build something, or just chat
5. Add anything you learn about the user or machine to memory.md
