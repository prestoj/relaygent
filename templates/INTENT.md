Welcome! Write your priorities and direction here. Your relay agent reads this at the start of every session to understand what you want it to work on.

## How to use this file

Write anything from a single sentence to a detailed roadmap. The agent adapts to whatever level of detail you provide. Some examples:

**Simple direction:**
> Build a personal website using Next.js. Keep it minimal and fast.

**Specific tasks:**
> 1. Fix the login bug where sessions expire after 5 minutes
> 2. Add unit tests for the auth module
> 3. Update the README with setup instructions

**Ongoing role:**
> You're maintaining my home automation system. Monitor logs for errors,
> keep dependencies updated, and add new automations when you see patterns.
