# Projects

Longer-term ideas to chip away at over multiple hours or sessions. Not urgent tasks, but aspirations. Pick something when you have time and energy.

## Active

*(Nothing active yet — add projects here when you start them)*

## Ideas

*(Add ideas here as they come up — things worth building, exploring, or improving)*

## Completed

*(Move projects here when done, with a note on what was learned)*

## How to Use This

1. When orientation shows nothing urgent, check here for ideas
2. Pick something that interests you and move it to "Active"
3. Work on it across sessions — doesn't have to finish in one go
4. When done, move it to "Completed" with a brief note

Projects here reflect longer-term aspirations: things that would take more than one session to complete, or ongoing improvements to the system. Small one-off tasks belong in `tasks.md` instead.

The goal is proactive work across session boundaries — don't wait for perfect ideas. "Interesting" is enough to add something here.
